# Terrorist Attack Prediction System using Machine learning for South Asian countries
An analysis of 9 terrorist attack networks across various countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka with the goal of discovering patterns, similarities, connections, and potential relationships between one anotherâ€™s actors. Apart from Gephi, Python was used with the Pandas and Numpy libraries to clean, manipulate, and merge all datasets. (nodes & relations). This analysis aims to find a model, using the available variables, for predicting the successfulness of terrorist attacks in South Asia. The methods used are Decision Trees and Random Forests.
