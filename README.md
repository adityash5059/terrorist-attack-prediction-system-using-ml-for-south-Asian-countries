# Terrorist Attack Prediction System using Machine learning for South Asian countries
An analysis of 9 terrorist attack networks across various countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka between the years using a Gephi network graph visualization with the goal of discovering patterns, similarities, connections, and potential relationships between one anotherâ€™s actors. Apart from Gephi, Python was used with the Pandas and Numpy libraries to clean, manipulate, and merge all datasets. (nodes & relations). This analysis aims to find a model, using the available variables, for predicting the successfulness of terrorist attacks in South Asia. The methods used are Decision Trees and Random Forests.
